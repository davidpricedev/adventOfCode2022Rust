# adventOfCode2022Rust

This repository contains my solutions for many of the puzzles in the [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

As I usually do, I've decided to learn a new language while solving these puzzles. This year the new language is Rust.

## Some notes about rust

At first glance, rust appears to borrow a lot from python

- same type syntax
- same preference for snake_case
- same self argument for all instance methods
- similar folder structure concepts (though thankfully no __init__.rs files needed!)
- even some libraries (itertools) have the same name as python
